    <h1>Preface</h1>
    <p>It turned out that many software components initially conceived
      for DCS found applications in non-DCS groups, e.g. in TDAQ or
      other forms of configuration software.<br>
    </p>
    <p>At the time of writing (Feb 2020) this applies mostly to:<br>
      <br>
      * open62541-compat<br>
      * UaObjects client for SCA OPC-UA<br>
      * LogIt<br>
    </p>
    <p>Quasar normally takes good care of integrating these software
      components, so as long as you develop quasar server(s), you are
      good and you do not have to think too much.<br>
    </p>
    <p>However, what happens when you abandon Quasar? Then you have to
      think how to deploy these dependencies.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This project is precisely made for that.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <p><br>
      OK, nothing fancy really:<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>setup your compiler (source or set paths of whatever). After
        this step, invoking "c++" should be routed to the compiler of
        choice. For example, in my case:<br>
        $ c++ --version<br>
        c++ (GCC) 8.3.0<br>
      </li>
      <li>decide where you'd like to deploy the software built by this
        script.<br>
        I (Piotr) normally deploy it to /opt but this might vary. <br>
        Note that deployment will be done by equivalent of "make
        install" so make sure that the target location is writable, etc.<br>
        The path you decided on will be used in the step below.<br>
      </li>
      <li>just run the scripts, e.g.:<br>
        ./prepare.sh --install_prefix /opt/tdaqQuasarEcosystem/gcc8.3.0<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
